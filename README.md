Guided Learning Module-Applied Data Science

The aim of this project is to predict flight delays accurately in order to optimise flight operations and minimum the delays. For this we use machine learning models such as decision tree classifiers to predict the arrival time. Python, HTML, JavaScript and CSS was used to build the same.
